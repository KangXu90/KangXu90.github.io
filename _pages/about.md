I am **Kang Xu**, a postdoctoral researcher at the **City College of New York (CUNY)**.  
My research focuses on **quantum sensing, diamond color centers, scanning probe microscopy, 2D materials, and nanoscale optoelectronic devices**. I am particularly interested in exploring quantum technologies for probing confined fluids, developing advanced instrumentation, and discovering new physical phenomena.

Previously, I conducted postdoctoral research at **Tsinghua University**, where I investigated optoelectronic and photovoltaic properties of 2D materials, and at the **Beijing Academy of Quantum Information Sciences**, where I worked on 2D heterostructure devices and spectroscopy systems.  
I received my **Ph.D. in Condensed Matter Physics** from **Nanjing University** (2018), and my **B.S. in Applied Physics** from **China University of Petroleum (East China)** (2012).  

I have authored and co-authored publications in journals including *Nature Communications*, *Nano Letters*, *ACS Applied Materials & Interfaces*, and *Nature Electronics*, with total citations exceeding **1800**.
